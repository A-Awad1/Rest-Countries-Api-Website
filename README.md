# Frontend Mentor - REST Countries API with color theme switcher

This challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

Users can:

- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode and the value stored in local storage

This challenge is responsive in all devices and I don't use any framework.

Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (ECMAScript , DOM , BOM , AJAX , Api JSON)

Additions under development:

- Test the website by Jest
- Use gulp plugins to help in maintenance
